A English to Pig Latin library written in F#. Put the LibPigLatin project with your other projects
that you would like to translate English to Pig Latin! Built and tested with .NET Core 2.2.

## Installation
First, you have to `git clone` this here project:
`git clone https://github.com/wymillerlinux/libpiglatin`

Next, install the .NET Core SDK, which you can find [here.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

Next, install your F# development environment. For example, install VS Code and install
the Ionide-Fsharp extension.

You're done! Mess with this small project to your hearts content.

## Running/Testing
You may test this here library with `dotnet test` tool:

All tests should pass unless you changed for the worst. Tread carefully, friend!

You could also run the F# REPL and try it out that way. It's quite fun what you could do
when you do this.

## Troubleshooting
This project is me trying F# developement over 2018 winter break. I'll most likely come back to this
with better knowledge under my belt. My email is [here](mailto:wjmiller2016@gmail.com) if you want to contact me about this project!
